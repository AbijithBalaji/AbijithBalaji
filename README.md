## Who am I? ü§î

I'm someone who's endlessly curious about how things around me work. You know that feeling when you see something and think "wait, how does this actually work?" Yeah, that's me with pretty much everything.

This curiosity drives me to explore random stuff all the time. One day I'm working on cybersecurity tools, the next I'm building note synchronization solutions, then maybe diving into AI projects or cloud infrastructure.

I love identifying problems that need solving and then figuring out what needs to be built to fix them. Sometimes that means learning new tech stacks, sometimes it's combining existing tools in creative ways. Most of this work happens under [Ogrelix](https://ogrelix.org/) - check it out if you've got some time!

## What keeps me busy? üõ†Ô∏è

### Problem-solving (aka building stuff that actually matters)

- **[ONI-Tester](https://oni.ogrelix.org/)** - Got tired of manual penetration testing, so I built an AI-powered tool that automates vulnerability assessments. Cut testing time by 40% and detects threats with 95% accuracy.

- **[Ogresync](https://github.com/AbijithBalaji/Ogresync)** - Couldn't justify another subscription just to sync my Obsidian notes. Built this open-source solution that handles Git integration, merge conflicts, and works across all platforms.

- **[CAMPUS](https://ogrelix.org/products/educational/campus) & [MASTER](https://ogrelix.org/products/educational/master)** - Our university didn't have a proper student portal. So we built one. Then we built a better one.

- **[TubeLearns](https://github.com/KabilPreethamK/tubelearns)** - Created a Python library for processing YouTube transcripts for ML projects, because sometimes the best datasets come from unexpected places.

### Research & Other Stuff üìö

I have some research experience - published work on YOLO models for object detection and presented at conferences about AI, IoT, and Blockchain integration. But mostly, I'm focused on building practical solutions.

### Learning random stuff üé∏

You'll probably find me:
- üé∏ **Playing guitar** - Music keeps me sane
- ‚å®Ô∏è **Touch typing** - Check out my [TypeRacer profile](https://data.typeracer.com/pit/profile?user=believertn)
- üêß **Distro-hopping** - Currently on Arch, but I'll probably be back on Fedora next month
- üìú **Reading about history and evolution** - Understanding the past gives perspective to everything
- üîß **Learning handiwork** - Carpentry, plumbing, fixing stuff. Getting professionals is expensive, and honestly, understanding how things work physically is just as fascinating as understanding code

## Why I love open-source üå±

Here's what blows my mind about open-source: people voluntarily contribute and build incredible things for fellow humans, often as a hobby. The fact that some of the most remarkable projects exist despite being underfunded proves something beautiful - when people with shared interests come together, genuine innovation happens.

That's what drives my projects. Not just building cool tech, but creating meaningful tools that actually help people solve real problems.

## Let's connect! üí¨

I'm always up for discussing interesting problems, sharing ideas, or just chatting about why Linux is a superior choice to Windows and Mac! üòÑ

I also write blogs about my perspectives on tech, philosophy, and random discoveries - check them out on [Medium](https://medium.com/@abijithbalaji)!
